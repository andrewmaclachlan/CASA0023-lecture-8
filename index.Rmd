# How to use the lectures



- Slides are made with [xaringan](https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/#1)

- `r fa("search")` In the bottom left there is a search tool which will search all content of presentation

- Control + F will also search 

- Press enter to move to the next result 

- `r fa("pencil-alt")` In the top right let's you draw on the slides, although these aren't saved.

- Pressing the letter `o` (for overview) will allow you to see an overview of the whole presentation and go to a slide

- Alternatively just typing the slide number e.g. 10 on the website will take you to that slide

- Pressing alt+F will fit the slide to the screen, this is useful if you have resized the window and have another open - side by side.

#  What is the Urban Heat Island 2

.pull-left[

**Two main** factors:

1. More dark surfaces that retain heat
1. Less vegetation that cools the environment (evapotranspiration and solar blocking)

But other factors include:

* A low Sky View Factor (SVF)
  * radiation received (or emitted) by a planar surface to the radiation emitted (or received) by the entire hemispheric environment
* air speed, cloud cover, cyclic solar radiation, building material type and anthropogenic energy

**Social**

* Population adjusted excess mortality rates during the 1998
Shanghai heatwave were estimated at **27.3 per 100,000 within the urban area** compared to only **7
per 100,000 in the exurban** districts [Tan et al. 2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00484-009-0256-x#:~:text=An%20examination%20of%20summer%20mortality,exposure%20to%20extreme%20thermal%20conditions.)

**Environmental**

* Each degree of ambient temperature rise the increase in peak
electricity load has been estimated between 0.45 and 4.6%, corresponding to around 21 W per
degree rise per person [Santamouris et al. 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778814007907)
* Fossil fuel + pollution
