# How to use the lectures



- Slides are made with [xaringan](https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/#1)

- `r fa("magnifying-glass")` In the bottom left there is a search tool which will search all content of presentation

- Control + F will also search 

- Press enter to move to the next result 

- `r fa("pencil")` In the top right let's you draw on the slides, although these aren't saved.

- Pressing the letter `o` (for overview) will allow you to see an overview of the whole presentation and go to a slide

- Alternatively just typing the slide number e.g. 10 on the website will take you to that slide

- Pressing alt+F will fit the slide to the screen, this is useful if you have resized the window and have another open - side by side.

#  What is the Urban Heat Island 3

.pull-left[

**Two main** factors:

1. More dark surfaces that retain heat
1. Less vegetation that cools the environment (evapotranspiration and solar blocking)

But other factors include:

* A low Sky View Factor (SVF)
  * radiation received (or emitted) by a planar surface to the radiation emitted (or received) by the entire hemispheric environment
* air speed, cloud cover, cyclic solar radiation, building material type and anthropogenic energy

**Social**

* Population adjusted excess mortality rates during the 1998
Shanghai heatwave were estimated at **27.3 per 100,000 within the urban area** compared to only **7
per 100,000 in the exurban** districts [Tan et al. 2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00484-009-0256-x#:~:text=An%20examination%20of%20summer%20mortality,exposure%20to%20extreme%20thermal%20conditions.)

**Environmental**

* Each degree of ambient temperature rise the increase in peak
electricity load has been estimated between 0.45 and 4.6%, corresponding to around 21 W per
degree rise per person [Santamouris et al. 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778814007907)

In the 1930s the American Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) was tasked with refinancing mortgages on properties to prevent missed payments. To do this the HOLC assessed the **"credit-worthiness" of neighbourhoods, dividing them largely on race into grades between A, considered the "best", and D considered "hazardous"**, drawn around in red, hence the term "redlining". Other services such as healthcare and infrastructure investments were decided in similar way

The Civil Rights Act of 1968 (the Fair Housing Act) made it unlawful to discriminate housing or financing in this manner. However, the redlining legacy has left severe social equity issues across cities, such as access to outdoor space, clean air and trees.

Reduction activities can be split into two themes.
The voluntary theme includes 
education and incentives such as Chicago’s exemplar green city hall roof 
Baltimore County’s growing home campaign offering vouchers for purchasing trees
The policy theme incorporates the UHI into metropolitan spatial development strategies:
The London Plan 
Perth and Peel @3.5 million 
Singapore’s Master Plan
However, these documents fail in planning practicality through absent mitigation methodologies at the local level. 
Alteration of UHI influential policies (e.g. zoning and building codes) permit quantifiable planning requirements such as Seattle’s ‘Green Factor’ and Baton Rouge’s landscape ordinance specifying minimum vegetation requirements for developments over certain sizes
Yet modern planning designs lack data- informed decisions which are resulting in sub-optimal UHI mitigation strategies with the global state of data-informed governance being described as underdeveloped, disparate and marginalized.

# Fremantle's Urban Forest Plan

.pull-left[
* First city to use data to inform their cooling / greening strategy 

* But, what are the issues with their approach?
  * Temperature image from one day in January 
  * Believe this is from Landsat data (see practical)
  * 30 m data that has been aggregated to block (street block level)
  * Not reproducible for other dates / cities
  * What assumptions were made

# Making sense of this 

.pull-left[

* There is a gap between global, metropolitan, local policy and data analysis

* The analysis needs to solve the problem and be usable

* Should we focus on **equal** access/ distribution or **equitable** access / distribution or providing environmental **justice**

* Are policies themselves the problem

* How could other cities use the same methods - e.g. could Sydney use the same temperature approach as Fremantle.

# Approaching projects

.pull-left[

**First**

* Search for EO data...we have seen (or will see) the following data
  * Temperature
  * Landcover
  * Pollution 
  * Elevation 
  * Texture / Spectral 
  * **Not** constrained to this list

* Identify an issue (look at local policy documents)

* Look at global policy documents (to see the link)

]

.pull-right[

**Second**

* What can be solved with the data **or** 

* What could this data contribute to another question (e.g. including it as a variable) **or**

* How could the remotely sensed data be included within a data workflow **or**

* Anything else as long as it includes EO data (or some sort, at some stage) and analysis for solving a policy question.
